## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was extremely tiresome ðŸ˜©! And there are still more fixing to do.
I learned that we should never take for granted a project because not a single one is simple enough.
Every project has its particularities and requisites that demands from us developers attention and care. I'm fisically destroyed for now, that's why I'll refactor JS afterwards.

### Continued development

- Refactor JS
- Refactor CSS

## Acknowledgments

I'm trully impressed about the quality of [@ceosphere](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Cheosphere)'s work!
I often look at his work in order to check if I'm in the right way. I hope someday I can write such a clean code.
